# BDSI-Cancer-Data-Science-Project
This repository contains my RMD files and poster from my BDSI Cancer Data Science Project, which investigated these research questions:
1. How do the Cox proportional hazards model and the Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) model compare in predicting survival in lung and ovarian cancer patients?
2. Which spatial features are significant predictors of survival in lung and ovarian cancer patients?
